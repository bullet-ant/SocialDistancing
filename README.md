# SocialDistancing
COVID-19 spread is emotionally challenging for many people, changing day-to-day life in unprecedented ways. All sections of society – including employers and employees, daily wage workers – should play a role to protect themselves and each other and help prevent further spread of the disease. WHO is providing advice and updated information on COVID-19, and on how employers can protect their employees, what measures they should take in the workplace, and other related factors. Even though the guidelines are issued it would become really a mess if any of the workers do not follow the guidelines. The solution is to create a system that uses pre-installed cameras to analyze images from a construction site to see whether workers are adhering to safety measures, like wearing a helmet, maintaining social distancing, etc.
